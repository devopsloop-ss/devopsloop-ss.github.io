            <h1>What is this about?</h1>

            
    <p>A blog by a DevOps engineer</p>
            <div style="margin-right: 20%;margin-left: 20%;"> 
                
                <p>Salutations!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been involved in various Cloud Operations and DevOps roles for quite some time now. When I initially informed my peers and family about my decision to pursue
a career as a DevOps Engineer directly after graduation, the bewildered expressions on their faces were priceless. It was only later that I realized this confusion was also
prevalent within the industry itself. There&rsquo;s no universally accepted definition of what DevOps precisely entails. For some, it&rsquo;s just a fancy new label for system administrators,
replacing terms like &ldquo;ops&rdquo; and &ldquo;sysops.&rdquo; For others, it&rsquo;s about leveraging various tools and technologies to automate repetitive tasks.</p>
<p>Whether an online or offline course, instructors typically present an infinity symbol to represent a continuous process, along with their own interpretations of its
various phases. In essence, DevOps can be anything a team or organization defines it to be. It can encompass a culture, a role, a profession, and more. Given its open-ended nature,
people often blend other related roles or fields, leading to the creation of intriguing sandwich-like combinations, such as MLOps, DataOps, AIOps, GitOps, DevCloudOps, DevDataOps,
DevDBOps, DevSecOps, DevMasalaPaneerDosaOps, and the like! This can be quite overwhelming for both beginners and seasoned professionals, making it difficult to determine precisely
what they need to know and do to achieve their personal and professional goals. Despite this uncertainty, I&rsquo;m still trying to pin down a specific way to define my role, situation,
and position. However, the true joy of working in this field lies in the uncertainty! You never know what tool, technology, or platform you&rsquo;ll be tasked with mastering, implementing,
and taking ownership of. It&rsquo;s not about the tool itself or established processes; it&rsquo;s about an unending adventure. Amidst all this uncertainty, the outcome of a DevOps professional&rsquo;s
efforts is a stable, scalable, and reliable application that can stoically handle changes. For me, that&rsquo;s the essence of DevOps as a profession.</p>
<p>The loop not only represents the various stages of the software development lifecycle and continuously evolving systems but also the continuous evolution of the teams,
individuals, and organizations that embark on this journey. Through this blog, I aim to share my experiences from this journey and invite your thoughts and insights. By sharing our
experiences, we can collectively learn and grow.</p>
